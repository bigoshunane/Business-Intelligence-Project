# New York Citibikes Analytics

The aim of this project is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs of New York City and find unexpected phenomena and 
design number of visualizations for each discovered phenomena.

# Data source
Monthly CSV files of 2020 (01/2020 to 12/2020) were collected from [Citi Bike Data](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage. Since the files size exceeeds github limit I could not be able to git push in to the repositroy, but the files can be found in repo as bikes.twbx.


# Visualizations
Few Visualizations with story telling are published on public tableau and found at this [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/workineh.shunane1801/viz/bikes_16511366012330/Story1?publish=yes). Note, I had to cut some visualiaztions from publishing on public tableau due to the limit of rows set by the software and my data rows exceeded the limit i.e. 15 000 000. As a consequence more visualization dashboards are computed and available at [file](https://github.com/bigoshunane/Tableau-Homework-13/blob/main/bikes.twbx) in repository. Moreover, listed in pictures below are list of visulazations together with analysis I have developed.



# Analysis

1. Number of Records

Total number of records were about 19 million. It appeared that ore bikes ride were recorded in the summer than in the winter. 
The possible reason could be that people are not willing to ride outside in winter due to the cold weather. September, 2020 had the
highest number of recordes at 2 488 101. while April,2020 had the lowest one at 682 744. In May, 2020 , the

In terms of the distance and duration, most young users rode citi bikes for short distance, while the older people rode for longer distance and duration.
